%{
    Duration Data Analytics for Armand

    This code takes treatment application data (position, duration of treatment, 
    and presence of an error) from a Particle.io Boron, passed from the Labview 
    program controlling a STAR system. It calculates descriptive statistics 
    (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for each position based on 
    the last 4500 data observations and plots them.
